<p>
  Every benchmark that should be run on the Hobbit platform needs to be uploaded to it. This uploading comprises several steps.
  Note that a <a href="https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/User-registration" target="_blank">user profile</a>  is necessary to have the right to upload something to the platform.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Before uploading, the benchmark has to be implemented in a way that it fits into the platform and is able to interact with
    the paltform controller. The general development of a benchmark is <a href="https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/Develop-a-benchmark"
      target="_blank">described here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The second step is the creation of at least one project in the <a href="http://git.project-hobbit.eu/" target="_blank">gitlab instance</a>    of the platform. For that you can use the same account as for the platform itself. (The project should have the same
    name as the system. Please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/System-docker-image"
      target="_blank">image upload</a> and its hints regarding the project name.)
  </li>
  <li>
    After creating the git project(s), you need to push the Docker image(s) to the git project(s) as <a href="https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/Push-a-docker-image"
      target="_blank">described here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The final step is to put the meta data describing the benchmark into a file called benchmark.ttl and push it to one of the
    git projects. The format of the file is <a href="https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/Benchmark-meta-data-file"
      target="_blank">described here</a>.
  </li>
</ol>
